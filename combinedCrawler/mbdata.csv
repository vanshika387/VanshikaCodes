Today, SOBHA, a Rs. 40 billion company, is the most trusted brand and only backward integrated real estate player in the country.Since inception, the Company has always strived for benchmark quality, customer centric approach, robust engineering, in-house research, uncompromising business ethics, timeless values and transparency in all spheres of business conduct, which have contributed in making it a preferred real estate brand in India. In 2006, SOBHA went public through its initial public offering, an event that created history when the issue got oversubscribed a record 126 times.Headquartered in Bengaluru, SOBHA is primarily focused on residential and contractual projects. The Company&rsquo;s residential projects include presidential villas, row houses, luxury and super luxury apartments, plotted developments and aspirational homes replete with world-class amenities.

Backward integration includes an interiors division, a metal works and glazing factory and a concrete products factory.

planned business district Of Gandhinagar City.",N/A,8+ years,1,N/A,1,"Nila Spaces Limited is a latest enterprise of Ahmedabad headquartered Sambhaav Group, pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement for Demerger (the 'Scheme') of Real Estate (RE) Undertaking of Nila Infrastructures Ltd (the &ldquo;Demerged Company&rdquo;/NI Ltd) into Nila Spaces Ltd (the 'Resultant Company') under section 230 to 232 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 with Appointed Date of April 1, 2017.In the process of executing projects for various Government/Semi Government entities, NI Ltd fathomed the size and scale of government&rsquo;s initiatives - 'Housing for All by 2022', and 'smart cities'. While, the government initiated the supply-side measures, it has simultaneously addressed the demand-side, too; by boosting the affordability with the reduction/subsidy in interest on housing loans, enhancement of ceiling for interest deduction, etc. Further, with implementation of path-breaking regulations - RERA and GST Act; the real estate business started getting the much needed impetus as an industry. The accordance of much coveted status of &ldquo;Infrastructure&rdquo; to Affordable Housing set the right atmosphere. Hence, with such collective positive transformation of critical dynamics of the real-estate industry; it was thought prudent to provide an undisturbed attention to the real-estate business by demerging it into a separate entity. The independent Real Estate Business would ensure a focused strategy and specialization for sustainable growth of the Real Estate Business while it would also support the initiatives taken by the Government to provide affordable housing.NI Ltd has been scaling new heights since its inception in the year 1990. In its journey of 31+ years, NI Ltd has built for itself an enviable position engaging in turnkey civic urban infrastructure developments besides soaring high in new generation lifestyles in the real estate space. The name Nila is synonymous with excellence. As a Sambhaav Group company and headquartered at Ahmedabad, NI Ltd has evolved over the years from its primary identity of a realty company to one which is now predominantly involved in the Affordable Housing. NI Ltd is a public limited company listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) as well as the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and is ISO 9001:2015 accredited.",Under Construction,N/A

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.",Under Construction,5

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.",Ready To Move,3

Founded in 1986, the group's turnover is today in excess of Rs. 3518 Cr (for FY 15); a leap that has been inspired by CMD Irfan Razack and marshaled by his brothers Rezwan Razack and Noaman Razack. Having completed 210 projects covering over 80 million sq ft sq ft, currently the company has 53 ongoing projects spanning 54 million sq ft sq ft and 35 upcoming projects aggregating to 48 million sq ft sq ft of world-class real estate space across asset classes. In October 2010, the Prestige Group also successfully entered the Capital Market with an Initial Public Offering of Rs 1200cr. Services are as varied as the interior designing done by Morph Design Company (MDC) and the redefinition of elegance and suave in men's formal dressing by Prestige Fashions (P) Ltd. They are also the only developers in South India to boast of such a widely diverse portfolio covering the residential, commercial, retail, leisure and hospitality segments.Now with 205 landmark developments across the city, the company has extended its expertise to major cities across South India including Chennai, Hyderabad, Kochi, Mysore, Mangalore and Goa Prestige Cyber Towers, Prestige Polygon and Prestige Palladium are three completed commercial developments, which have received an overwhelming response. The Forum Vijaya Mall, Chennai's largest mall was unveiled in 2013. The Prestige Group launched Chennai's first township project &ndash; a Rs. 1,000 crore development in partnership with the Rattha Group in 2012. They also launched Prestige Silver Springs &ndash; the first-of-its-kind luxury villas in the city in 2013.The Prestige Group today has become a name that is synonymous with innovation. The company has pioneered many landmark developments and introduced many firsts to South India:Prestige Acropolis: A tribute to classical Greek architecture, one of the first Premium residential developments in BangalorePrestige Ozone: One of the first gated communities in BangaloreThe Forum mall: Pioneered the retail revolution in Bangalore.

We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.",Under Construction,N/A

Founded in 1986, the group's turnover is today in excess of Rs. 3518 Cr (for FY 15); a leap that has been inspired by CMD Irfan Razack and marshaled by his brothers Rezwan Razack and Noaman Razack. Having completed 210 projects covering over 80 million sq ft sq ft, currently the company has 53 ongoing projects spanning 54 million sq ft sq ft and 35 upcoming projects aggregating to 48 million sq ft sq ft of world-class real estate space across asset classes. In October 2010, the Prestige Group also successfully entered the Capital Market with an Initial Public Offering of Rs 1200cr. Services are as varied as the interior designing done by Morph Design Company (MDC) and the redefinition of elegance and suave in men's formal dressing by Prestige Fashions (P) Ltd. They are also the only developers in South India to boast of such a widely diverse portfolio covering the residential, commercial, retail, leisure and hospitality segments.Now with 205 landmark developments across the city, the company has extended its expertise to major cities across South India including Chennai, Hyderabad, Kochi, Mysore, Mangalore and Goa Prestige Cyber Towers, Prestige Polygon and Prestige Palladium are three completed commercial developments, which have received an overwhelming response. The Forum Vijaya Mall, Chennai's largest mall was unveiled in 2013. The Prestige Group launched Chennai's first township project &ndash; a Rs. 1,000 crore development in partnership with the Rattha Group in 2012. They also launched Prestige Silver Springs &ndash; the first-of-its-kind luxury villas in the city in 2013.The Prestige Group today has become a name that is synonymous with innovation. The company has pioneered many landmark developments and introduced many firsts to South India:Prestige Acropolis: A tribute to classical Greek architecture, one of the first Premium residential developments in BangalorePrestige Ozone: One of the first gated communities in BangaloreThe Forum mall: Pioneered the retail revolution in Bangalore. Globally-recognised and probably the first successful retail mall in the country which created new benchmarks in modern day retailing.Forum Value Mall: South India's first real outlet mall featuring international and national brandsThe Collection, UB City: South India's first luxury mall (Partnered initiative with Vijay Mallya &ndash; UB Group)Prestige Golfshire: South India's first golf villa development set against the picturesque Nandi Hills.

This development introduces Disney-inspired residences to Bangalore.Inspired by the unmatched success of The Forum mall, the Prestige Group is redefining the concept of shopping in malls by taking the &lsquo;Forum' brand forward to several cities across South India. Six more Forum malls are currently under construction across Bangalore, Mysore and Kochi, covering another 3 million sq ft sq ft of retail space. The Forum Vijaya Mall, Chennai's largest mall was unveiled in 2013. The company inaugurated the Forum Fiza mall in Mangalore and the Forum Sujana mall in Hyderabad in 2014. Also, the popularity of Forum Value Mall, the only outlet mall in South India, has encouraged the company to develop more malls along the same lines.On the hospitality front, the Prestige Group has been credited with introducing some of the most reputed international brands in the world to South India, such as the Hilton Group and Marriott International for hotels; the Banyan Tree for resorts; and Oakwood for service apartments.

Rewind back to 1987. Bhartiya Group had just started designing leather apparel and accessories for the fashion conscious. A tough market to crack, it wasn&rsquo;t long before the chicest designs from our studios in Milan were being adapted by brands like Hugo Boss, Armani, Zara and Mango. From designer bags to well-cut jackets, our team had an eye for detail and a talent for beautiful design.With a newly found fashion-tycoon status, Bhartiya&rsquo;s founder, Snehdeep Aggarwal was fortunate enough to travel to the world&rsquo;s finest cities. It&rsquo;s what caught his eye on the streets of Munich, Florence and London that became the inspiration behind the Bhartiya vision. Cities where people cycled to work safely and even the common man could afford a home. This wasn&rsquo;t like life back home, but why couldn&rsquo;t it be?Conventions questioned and inspiration in hand, Snehdeep returned to India with a plan. A big plan. In fact, it was a 125-acre city plan capable of offering a whole new way of life. Bhartiya City was born. The Bhartiya team is formed of the world&rsquo;s freshest thinking urban planners and the most exclusive architects on the international scene. They include Perkins Eastman-New York, Cox-Sydney, BDP Khandekar-Amsterdam for master planning, Broadway Malayan-Singapore for residential, retail and hotels and Edifice-Mumbai for the IT Park, amongst many others.It took two decades for us to enter the world of realty, but our team comes from a solid background of design and no matter what market you&rsquo;re in, the principles of good design remain the same. Whether it&rsquo;s a flawlessly made shirt, or a house that feels just like home, we strive to create better lifestyles through exceptional design.",Under Construction,1

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.",Under Construction,3

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.",Under Construction,N/A

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.
