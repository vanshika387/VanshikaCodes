Middle class India, on its ride along the country&rsquo;s growth story, was desperate for good quality housing that was hard to find in its budget range. It was against this background that Om Gupta set up Ashiana Housing as a game changer. Ashiana Housing was to give to the middle-class home owner features that were hitherto seen only in higher income level group housing: top quality construction, manicured lawns, expanse of greenery, children&rsquo;s play areas, swimming pools, clubs, a calendar of social activities for the whole family, and a full roster of maintenance services.As bottomline grew healthier and awards started pouring in, Ashiana Housing walked on another unique path &ndash; it pioneered the retirement home movement in India where seniors could lead safe, active, enjoyable and comfortable lives.
