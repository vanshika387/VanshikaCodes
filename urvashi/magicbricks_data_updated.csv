Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Kalyan West, Beyond Thane",Rs 44.8 Lac - Rs 84.2 Lac,N/A,N/A,1176,8 Acre,N/A,"Club House, Coffee Lounge & Restaurants, Cafeteria/Food Court, Bar/Lounge, Jogging and Strolling Track, Outdoor Tennis Courts, Cycling & Jogging Track, Power Back Up, Swimming Pool, Lift, Security, Reserved Parking, Service/Goods Lift, Visitor Parking, Intercom Facility, Bank & ATM, Banquet Hall, Gymnasium, Indoor Games Room, Flower Gardens, Piped Gas, Rain Water Harvesting, RO Water System, Indoor Squash & Badminton Courts, Multipurpose Courts, Meditation Area, Vaastu Compliant, Internet/Wi-Fi Connectivity, Mini Cinema Theatre, Large Open space, Grand Entrance lobby, Multipurpose Hall, Solar Energy, CCTV Camera, Fire Sprinklers, Barbeque space, Kids play area, Library, Shopping center, Cycling track, Cricket net practice, Sewage treatment plant, Aesthetically designed landscape garden, Outdoor Tennis Courts, Fire Fighting Equipment",45,1 & 2 BHK specious apartment | $towers storyed towers with $unit to be launched | 20 Acres of land area with 1100+ trees in development | 70% open to sky area with land parcel | Rainwater harvesting and Water Management System | Sky lounge with sky gym | Organic Farming | All flats are open facing | The hub of the future thane ext.,"Mulund: 10 Min | Airoli: 15 Min | Powai: 25 Min | Vikroli: 25 min | Borivali: 20 min | 20 mins from Majiwada junction | 15 mis from Kalyan railway station | Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport: 45 min | Chhatrapati Shivaji Domestic Airport: 50 min | Majiwada: 20 Mins | Mumbai - Nashik Expressway: 1 Min | Upcoming Metro Station*: 1 Min | Ved Hospital: 10 Mins | Bhiwandi Station: 6 Mins | Cinepolis: 20 Mins | Tree House International School: 15 Mins | Open and green spaces spread over hectares | Convenience zone with 24/7 concierge assistance | Experience the Sky Zone with star gazing deck, gym, and meditation pavilion | Exotic Wellness Zone with Laughter Therapy Zone, Organic Plantation Area, Yoga Garden, and more | Convenient shuttle service, 50+ facilities | Upcoming metro line 5 connecting Thane to Kalyan via Bhiwandi | Open and green spaces spread over hectares | Convenience zone with 24/7 concierge assistance | Experience the Sky Zone with star gazing deck, gym, and meditation pavilion | Exotic Wellness Zone with Laughter Therapy Zone, Organic Plantation Area, Yoga Garden, and more | Convenient shuttle service, 50+ facilities | Upcoming metro line 5 connecting Thane to Kalyan via Bhiwandi","['Main Door: Teak Wood Door Frames with Laminate Finish Flush Doors', 'Electrical: Concealed Electrical Wiring with Roma/Equivalent Fittings', 'Kitchen: Black Granite Platform and Nirali Stainless Steel Sink', 'Windows: Anodized Aluminum Windows with Superior Quality Glass and Fittings', 'Toilets: Concealed Plumbing, Jaquar/Equivalent Fittings', 'Balcony: Vitrified tiles', 'Kitchen: Vitrified tiles', 'Living/Dining: Vitrified Tiles 2X2', 'Master Bedroom: Vitrified Tiles 2X2', 'Other Bedroom: Vitrified Tiles 2X2', 'Toilet: Ceramic Tiles', 'Interior: Gypsum Finished with Quality Paint', 'Kitchen: Dado 4 ft above Platform', 'Toilets: Dado up to 7 ft Height']",N/A,N/A,Under Construction,01 August 2019,01 December 2024,6

We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Mamurdi, Pune",Rs 70 Lac - Rs 90 Lac,3 BHK Flats,Rs 6204,1210,8 Acre,N/A,"Club House, Jogging and Strolling Track, Power Back Up, Swimming Pool, Lift, Park, Reserved Parking, Service/Goods Lift, Visitor Parking, Intercom Facility, Maintenance Staff, Banquet Hall, Gymnasium, DTH Television Facility, Piped Gas, Rain Water Harvesting, Conference Room",17,Living in natural surroundings | cozy environment effortlessness,INOX  20 mins* | Fun Square Multiplex 20 mins* | City Pride Royal Cinemas 20 mins* | E-Square Carnival Xion 21 mins* | PVR Cinemas 22 mins* | Sentosa Resort & Water Park 07 mins* | Ginger Hotel 10 mins* | Hotel Bluewater  12 mins* | The Orritel Hotel 17 mins* | MCA Stadium 2 mins*,"['<div>Living/Dining: Vitrified Tiles</div><div>Master Bedroom: Vitrified Tiles</div><div>Other Bedroom: Vitrify Tiles</div><div>Kitchen: Vitrified flooring</div><div>Toilets: Anti Skid Tiles</div><div>Balcony: Anti Skid Tiles</div><div>Interior: Paint, Distemper</div><div>Exterior: Paint, Distemper</div><div>', '</div>']",Residential,Flat,Under Construction,01 February 2019,01 March 2025,7

Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability.

Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades.

Often, these structures shape more than just the environments and lifestyles of the people living in them; they shape the future blueprints of entire cities. At Rustomjee, it is our constant endeavour to transform the city with every building of ours. When we incorporate playgrounds and swimming pools into our designs, it's not just to offer our customer better amenities, but to offer their children better childhoods. When we push ourselves to find innovative solutions, it is not so much to save costs, as it is to save our environment.As a developer, Rustomjee has always believed that form follows function. This is evident in every aspect of our design and the way we plan homes. Rustomjee also lays special emphasis on the quality of its homes and expects everyone in the team to follow the rule of 'Better, not cheaper'. We realise that buying of a home is more than just a transaction; it is the realisation of an important dream. Which is why, customer-centricity is the very essence of our brand DNA and the many satisfied customers we've had bear testimony to this fact.Rustomjee also believes in giving back to the society within which we function and our education initiatives are one of many steps we've taken in this direction. By identifying potential, giving everyone equal opportunity and nurturing talent, we're helping create the next generation of leaders. Since we set out on this journey, we have transformed 10 million sq ft square feet of the city into premium townships, corporate parks, retail spaces and over 8,500 homes. In the last five years alone, we've delivered 8 million sq ft square feet of construction area, with a special focus on the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.As we move forward, we hope to go from strength to strength, and aim to add another 13 million sq ft square feet to our portfolio in the next five years. Ambitious as this goal may be, we know that with our customers and partners by our side, this dream too will soon be a reality.","Thane West, Thane",1.04 Cr,"1,2,3 BHK Flats",Rs 11581,391,100 Acre,"1,2,3","Club House, Cafeteria/Food Court, Bar/Lounge, Jogging and Strolling Track, Outdoor Tennis Courts, Barbeque Pit, Power Back Up, Swimming Pool, Lift, Security, Park, Reserved Parking, Service/Goods Lift, Visitor Parking, Intercom Facility, Maintenance Staff, Bank & ATM, Banquet Hall, Guest Accommodation, Gymnasium, Indoor Games Room, Kids Club, AEROBICS ROOM, Laundry Service, Piped Gas, Rain Water Harvesting, Water Storage, Indoor Squash & Badminton Courts, Arts & Craft Studio, Multipurpose Courts, Meditation Area, Vaastu Compliant, Internet/Wi-Fi Connectivity, Fingerprint Access, Premium branded fittings, Waste Disposal, Conference Room, Mini Cinema Theatre, Earth quake resistant, Health club with Steam / Jaccuzi, Located in the Heart of city, Large Clubhouse, 3 Tier Security System, Large Open space, Grand Entrance lobby, Multipurpose Hall, Solar Energy, Kids play area, Library, Activity Deck4, Aesthetically designed landscape garden, Badminton court, Outdoor Tennis Courts, Event Space & Amphitheatre, Kids Play Pool With Water Slides, Fire Fighting Equipment",56,100 + Acres of self-sufficient Township | Township with modern living spaces | 32+ amenities | Offer views of Thane City and Yeoor Hills | The best of nature and urban life at once | Located in Majiwada- one of the prestigious locations | Adjacent to National Highway | 5 minutes away from Viviana Mall | Sustainable development with global architecture | Well-established social infrastructure | RERA approved | 5 minutes away from Majiwada Metro | Multi-tier safety and security system,,"['2 & 3 bedroom air-conditioned homes', 'Provision for inverter in the apartment', 'Vitrified tiles in the living room, kitchen, passage and all bedrooms', 'Water purifier in kitchen', 'Premium CP fittings', 'Steel gray granite counter in the kitchen', 'Single kitchen sink with drainboard']",Residential,Flat,Under Construction,01 November 2021,01 December 2026,1

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Kolshet Road, Thane",85.7 Lac,"1,2,3 BHK Flats",Rs 12750,800,6 Acre,N/A,"Jogging and Strolling Track, Power Back Up, Swimming Pool, Lift, Security, Park, Reserved Parking, Intercom Facility, Maintenance Staff, Gymnasium, Indoor Games Room, Indoor Squash & Badminton Courts, Multipurpose Courts, Meditation Area, Premium branded fittings, 3 Tier Security System, Multipurpose Hall, CCTV Camera, Kids play area, Kids Splash Pool, Half basketball court, Sand pit, Badminton court, Outdoor Tennis Courts, Event Space & Amphitheatre, Fire Fighting Equipment",26,"Super luxury lifestyle | A class above anything else | Iconic towers in fabulous glass finishes | Premium lifestyle amenities | Well planned, aesthetically laid out stylishly finished | Latest automation to make life comfortable and easy | Rainbow pre-shool 3 min | C.P Goenka internal School 5 min | D-Mart 2 min | Globle hospital 5 min | Closed to Eastern expess highway and ghod bunder road.",,"['Super luxury lifestyle', 'A class above anything else', 'Iconic towers in fabulous glass finishes', 'Premium lifestyle amenities', 'Well planned, aesthetically laid out stylishly finished', 'Latest automation to make life comfortable and easy', 'Rainbow pre-shool 3 min', 'C.P Goenka internal School 5 min', 'D-Mart 2 min', 'Globle hospital 5 min', 'Closed to Eastern expess highway and ghod bunder road.']",Residential,Flat,Under Construction,01 March 2022,01 December 2028,5

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Bakeri Group, through its Sakar series of commercial buildings, brought the concept of corporate office buildings to Gujarat. And it was the first developer in India to be awarded as the highest PA-1 rating by CRISIL for SAKAR-III project in October 1995. From the beginning, Bakeri group has believed in and has constantly striven to repay its moral debt to society. It believes in working towards making a difference to society by providing services that will uplift the standard of living and cover basic human needs.To our understanding, ensuring efficiency and transparency in the real estate sector is the primary objective of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016. We also intend to promote the same, to the extent we can, by providing a platform to display all relevant information which is publicly available in an organized format relating to a particular property at a single place, however, at all times do keep in mind that the information that has been provided on magicbricks.com.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.
