R256111,Sobha City,2 months agoThe society is fine but be careful if you are looking to invest here specifically in the apartments at the back side . There is an open drain near the society because of which at random times a very bad smell comes all around the society. During night time specially and it becomes impossible to sleep due to the smell. The society is doing nothing about it and you cannot expect the govt to do anything anytime soon. ,negative
R256111,Sobha City,4 years agoGreat construction and a well maintained project. One of the best if someone is looking forward for end use. Prices are high if you compare with cheap overrated projects near by.But the quality they are offering is class apart. Besides the basic amenities they have ensured the optimum utilisation of the land and have kept landscaping in a tidy state. Even though the project is under construction the project is managed in a superb manner vis a vis many projects delivered in the area. This makes the project remarkable and Unique looking forward for the delivery. ,positive
R256111,Sobha City,"3 years agoBest construction quality and well thought out architecture hands down! We have been provided with the progress reports diligently and before hand over the flat, they asked us to inspect and point out any snag post which the final payment is taken. Worth every penny. ",positive
R256111,Sobha City,"10 months agoNot a tenant friendly society. They have mandatory introduced moving in and moving out charges of Rs. 5900 both times that too only for tenants. Their tractor rule to transfer goods is totally a waste and makes you feel miserable. No authority lies with the people sitting in their FMD department and they never respond to tenants over email and if you want to discuss anything they never pick tenants phone. Simply, tenant can not talk and discuss with management for anything. In winters it’s too cold to live and in summers it’s too hot. No proper system of water, dg backup and lots of things despite this they are charging maintenance heavily. Even normal electricity is 7.2 per unit and is disastrous in summer as they won’t have proper backup system. You will find cats and dogs roam freely in parking and underneath your car. ",negative

R256111,Sobha City,"5 years agoLocated in Dwarka Expressway on the border of Delhi and Gurugram. Sobha is undoubtedly one of the most renowned and reliable real estate developers of India. Recently had a visit to Sobha City to know more about its project and was warmly received and entertained by the sales executives including by Deputy Manager, Sales Ms Sanju Saini. They also show us the sample flat and construction specifications and as to how their quality is superior and above mark. We were also taken to construction site and the building under construction. The quality of construction and overall planning seems very promising. Importance was given to even fine details. However price of appartment appears to be on a bit higher side and moreover Dwarka Expressway is still underdeveloped and that's the only matter of concern. If anyone looking for quality construction and a reputable developer then should give a visit to Sobha city in my opinion.",positive

R256111,Sobha City,"8 months agoSobha is a big name and that's why we invested our hard earn money in Sector 108, gurgaon project. Recently they handed C4 TOWER. We are very disheartened to see the blunder mistake they did with our apartment they handed to us. The passage marble flooring was in 2 different colour marble and totally mismatched from the living area. First their team tried to convince us by giving many excuses. But when we escalated the matter to higher authorities they ready to change it. Now it has been almost more then a month, they changed the passage marble twice and still it is mismatched and cracked as well. They put 4 different slabs with different color and size as well. No one is helping us in this matter and all the Sobha personnels trying to put this mistake on each other or sometime they don't even bother to reply us. If any person knows Mr. RAVI MENON'S contact number or the way we can reach to him, please let us know. Thanks ""The team is just wasting our time."" ",negative
R256111,Sobha City,"Only good thing is infrastructure in the society not out there, There is no road to travel, even village roads are better then roads available, I have visited as I got intrest to buy flat there but after seeing roads conditions I dropped this location and project, kindly check all things outside also before investing your hard earned money.

R2966,ALTA,"If you are considering to buy or rent a flat here, better think twice. By looking at swimming pool photos, don't get fooled. Please check the lift in few towers, that itself tells you how poor the maintenance. If you are visiting the flat, check the lights, water tap, western toilet flush, that tells the current state of property. Since the apartment is very old, all these are in end of life. Once you move in, all these things goes off one by one. If you call apartment maintenance team, they take 1 week to attend the issue. All these spare parts cost falls on your head. Check the water colour in bathroom,kitchen. You and your kids have to use that water only. Above all, the house owners think very high about their flat by staying somewhere else and ask for high deposit and rent. I have stayed in nearby apartments and moved in thinking this will be good. But, its one of the worst apartment in this area. ",negative

R2966,ALTA,"If you are going to buy or rent flat consider the points below I have stayed here more than 3 year, found the followings It have no water source, it depends only on the external water tankers. Sewage water(Waste Water) also depends on the Sewage tankers. Wastage management also depends on the private cleaners. For basic amenities you should travel at-least of 3-4 kms.

Everything is as usual and they are fooling people. No changes at all. They even do not bother about internal finishing(stair cases, lift sides, railings ) of the building even after 2.5 years and now crying to move out.

R267281,SBP City of Dreams,"Worst Project and rules in this project. Unnecessary charges for parking, house purchasing and things. I cannot even meet my friends living in this society. The management and the security guard are little unprecedented and little unpolite. What does it mean Bachelor's are not allowed, are we criminals? If someone complaints about us or something I would be the most apologetic person you can find however making judgment on behalf of one individual or some individual, this is rouge. ",negative
R267281,SBP City of Dreams,"I am very disappointed with my experience at SBP City of Dreams. I lived in their property for almost 10 months, during which time I paid a security deposit and monthly maintenance fees. However, it has now been 4 months since I moved out, and the management is not helping me get my security deposit refunded.

Despite my repeated follow-ups, the maintenance staff is not responsive and is not providing any updates on the status of my security deposit return. I have been contacting them every other day, but they do not seem to be making any effort to resolve this issue.

The lack of customer service and transparency from SBP City of Dreams management is extremely frustrating. They have not provided any breakdown of the maintenance fees I paid or explained why my security deposit is being withheld. This has caused me a lot of unnecessary stress and financial inconvenience.

I would not recommend living at SBP City of Dreams, as they clearly do not prioritize taking care of their residents, even after they have moved out. Their poor service and unresponsiveness are unacceptable. I am very disappointed with my overall experience and hope others can learn from my situation.",negative

R206111,Windsor Troika,"We purchased an apartment at Windsor Troika and had it registered in December 2024. We have had a satisfying experience during the entire transaction, to begin with we dropped directly at the site sales office itself and were greeted by very courteous Mr. Mukunda the Sales Head who made us comfortable ,took us through the introduction to the property ,Site visit & the initial booking process.

Following this we have had a very comfortable experience purchasing our apartment, thanks to the co-operation & support provided by CRM team Geetha, and Deepak from the very beginning till the time of registration & handover of the property.

Both the Sales & CRM teams were always available to answer our questions and guide us through the queries & required procedures .

We appreciate their care in creating a truly memorable experience in purchasing the property .",positive
R206111,Windsor Troika,"We recently purchased a property here , and we couldn't be more satisfied with our experience. The space itself is fantastic — it’s well-ventilated and designed to provide ample natural light, creating a comfortable and refreshing environment.

From the very beginning, the customer relationship management (CRM) team@ Geetha Mam, was incredibly helpful and cooperative. She ensured that every step of the process was smooth and clear. The sales team was equally supportive, always available to answer our questions and guide us through the entire procedure.

Their assistance made the property registration process seamless, and we truly felt supported throughout.

The visit, negotiations and the office work to complete the registration, possesion and handing over the keys were so fast and smooth because of the efficient CRM and staff in the office. As far as the Troika structure quality and my stay in the house yet to experience. How ever I am confident that all comforts will be available as per the promises made by the builder because this is a 2nd deal with windsor in 10 years. I can honestly say that Windsor Troika is one amongst the best projects with large space and well ventilated flats. The builder has paid great attention to quality, which is evident in the structure and finishing. The location is ideal, with easy access to work hubs, markets, and schools. The amenities are fantastic, and the overall atmosphere is peaceful. Whether it’s the green spaces or the modern clubhouse, everything here is designed to give you a high quality of life. ",positive
R206111,Windsor Troika,"Windsor Troika is a rare breed among the long list of builders in Bangalore and a game changer in the real estate market. We have recently booked a 3BHK apartment and must confess that our apartment, common amenities, building complex, construction quality and pricing have exceeded all our expectations. We are indeed lucky and blessed to have this deal
worked out in a seamless manner by a team of efficient CRM and Sales staff at Windsor.

The property at Akshaya Nagar is considered a strategic and growing location, between the yellow and pink metro lines. This makes it attractive for working professionals to commute to their main work locations across Bengaluru. The complex is located in a serene and peaceful environment with well-maintained common areas, broad walkways, beautiful gardens, infinity pool, tennis court, badminton court and cricket practice pitch to name a few highlights. The Multistoried car parking is rare to witness in apartment complexes and this saves a lot of space for the owners.

While we have visited many complexes, Windsor Troika is definitely unique. Firstly, the land is not cluttered with multiple towers. A simple model with all major amenities and just two towers spread around 4 -5 Acres shared among 330 apartments gives everyone a lot of living and breathing space. Needless to say, one gets quite a bit of undivided property share. While there is definitely a good sense of community living, one can utilize these top-class amenities without waiting in long queues, quite common with large apartment complexes having many towers with shared amenities.

We would like to sincerely thank MD Srinivas Rao for being kind enough and allocating us two adjacent car parking spaces at the floor of our choice. We sincerely wish him all the very best for his future endeavors and hope that Windsor Edifices gets listed in the equity markets and reach greater heights with a large market capitalization.",positive

We all are afraid for our safety nowadays based on the following points:
- Water leaking to the basement from various places (expansion joints, damaged pipes, blocked drain system, etc.)
- Leak water in the basement creates seepage, weakening the pillars, creating a bad smell, spreading mosquitos, etc.
- Frequent breakdown of lifts. Randomly freezes on any floor and the rescue system barely works.

Metro-connectivity is at a 10-15min drive.

It's enjoys neighbourhood of a good gendry of Purvanchal Royal City and Shopping complex in front of it for daily needs.
The facilities are currently very good with well maintained swimming pool, gym, yoga, library, billiards, kids play zone, etc.

The peripheral apartments enjoys the far sight sun setting view of green farmland, hindan river, Noida 152 high rise development across the River and Metro line along with Noida-G.Noida express as a Cityscape.

People living are gentle and well behaved mix of elderly & mid-ages owners along with young students living on rent (due to neighbourhood universities) in the premises.
Nimbus employees and current maintenance team are cooperative.

R11112,Shriram Sameeksha,"Will never ever go with Shriram Properties again, worst decision to buy a flat with them. They will not even respond to your queries or assign someone to resolve your issue... It's 'we don't care attitude' once the flat is sold. Parking was assigned 200 meters away from flat which was highlighted but the mails were left unread and unacknowledged. ",negative
R11112,Shriram Sameeksha,"I would not want to give any stars to this builder.

Regret the decision of buying a property at Shriram Sameeksha. No complains on the quality of the construction, however, the customer service of the company is pathetic.

The staff have a very "" I don't care attitude because they know that even if a customer goes to top management as well, there will be no resolution.

The handover of the apartment was due last Mar 2016. In spite of the delay we have not made any noise and have been prompt on payment. Now there is a very petty issue of tiles to be changed which the builder is not able to rectify and is only prolonging to give handover. The builder is also threatening to charge interest for withholding the last payment and the staff is expecting the customer to follow up with their internal teams for the work to be done.

Have gone up to the COO desk, and have not got any resolution from there as well. So obviously you can't expect much from the staff when management itself is not concerned.

R11112,Shriram Sameeksha,"Very good apartment with spacious environment and packed with essential amenities,,, overall a very good place to live with peace and happy,,, but they are very poor in issuing khatas for the flats,,,, because that much delay we are facing in getting our khatas even we have been paid for it in right time. Sriram group pls consider this khata issue and make the khata delivery fast as soon as possible ",positive
R11112,Shriram Sameeksha,"The apartment has lot of amenities inside.

Drawback is the connectivity to the nearest bus stop.

R11112,Shriram Sameeksha,"Excellent property next to Airforce Forest and the Jarakbandi nature reserve, though away from hustle and bustle of city , this property is just 5 kms from Jalahalli metro station and 12 kms from MG road. It is rera registered , apartment complex has got oc and khata . ",positive
R22804,Pareena Mi Casa,"Pros:
1. Backup is available
2. Clubhouse (Active Amenities): Basketball, Badminton (Outdoor), Swimming Pool (Outdoor), Gym, Yoga Room (Though it can accommodate max. 5 people)
3. Clubhouse (In-progress Amenities): Banquet Hall, Amphitheatre
4. Commercial Complex: It's in-progress
5. Flat sizes (1000+ Sq Ft for 2 BHK, 1500+ & 2000+ Sq Ft. for 3BHKs)
6. Balcony size is good
7. Prices are lower than Tulip societies (with similar amenities) as it's in the same locality of Tulip

Cons:
1. Maintenance team is very lazy. They don't do any work without following up minimum 5 times. They will send you to builder team and builder team will send you to maintenance for small small works. It's pathetic in this regard.
2. Construction finishing is not done well. You will have to spend 3-4 months to get the finishing done as they don't do the work without following up minimum 5 times.
3. On backup, even one AC is not working.
4. It gets a lot of cold in winters here as it's an open area with cool breezes.",negative
R22804,Pareena Mi Casa,Great property with several amenities. It has been managed well by facility team. Project and CRM team are very responsive and supporting. ,positive
R22804,Pareena Mi Casa,"The only positive aspect of this society is that the flats are spacious and well-designed, offering ample living space. However, the overall experience is far from satisfactory. The construction quality is poor, with seepage issues appearing within the first year itself. The maintenance team is highly unresponsive, often ignoring complaints or taking weeks—sometimes even months—to resolve basic issues.

One of the biggest concerns is electricity. Despite having a DG backup, power cuts are frequent, especially during summer, as the management seems to prefer running on DG to charge higher rates. While all nearby societies, including those around Pareena Micassa, have electricity, this society conveniently remains without power, as per the maintenance team’s explanation. The maintenance charges are also unreasonably high, yet the services provided are subpar.

Another major drawback is the internet service. No external internet providers are allowed because the society has an exclusive tie-up with a local vendor, whose service is highly unreliable. Frequent disruptions make it frustrating, and to make matters worse, residents are forced to purchase the in-house Wi-Fi just to get an extension.

Overall, the society functions in a monopolistic manner, prioritizing profits over resident welfare. Even rural areas seem to have better electricity availability than what is provided here.",negative
R22804,Pareena Mi Casa,The Pareena society is really going to be a nice place for living out of hustle busle of city. The CRM team has been extremely cooperative and helpful in carrying out all the work and still committed to good quality before hand over. ,positive
R22804,Pareena Mi Casa,"Just received the keys of our flat here in Tower 5, Pareena Micasa. Tower 1,2,3 looks very much occupied, and in tower 5 also, people have started moving in and getting interiors done.

Looking forward to get shifted here soon :) ",positive

R22804,Pareena Mi Casa,"
Have been staying here for 1.5 years. Please don't go with the 5 star reviews, they are paid reviews or by the people who want to hike the prices of this place.

Here is the honest review:
TLDR: Please don't buy flat at this society. Your hard earned money will go complete waste. If you are looking to rent, make sure your owner has solved all their issues with the society. Still we would not recommend renting this place.

CONS:
1. Building construction quality is very poor
2. Maintenance and project team: Unresponsive and keep passing the work to each other.
3. Consistent Seepage issues in the flats.
4. Absurd parking charges for extra car. They are asking for 36K per year for an additional car.
5. No facilities or amenities. We were told, everything will be ready in 6 months, but it's been 1.5 years and still there no amenities.",negative
R22804,Pareena Mi Casa,"Overall experience with civil team, specially Mr.Kapil(Civil Manager @Micasa) is extremely cooperative throughout the construction process and guided us till handover and given confidence to provide technical support and help even beyond handover with smiling face.

R370626,Risinia Skyon,"The overall experience with Risinia sales team was not pleasant. They lack internal coordination and gave us wrong information which led to too many to and fro. They mentioned incorrect completion timelines.Only after probing I found out their actual RERA completion date is 2026( I found out by checking in govt websites). If I'd have bought the property basis sales team's word, I'd have made a bad decision which would majorly impact me financially. One of the seniors in Risinia head office gave us correct information.

The sales team needs some proactiveness. You need to remind them to share the data/documents/or even location. A Salesman literally told us 2bhk are sold out even when they were still available. Another salesman later told us about the availability and showed the flats.

We were really inclined to buy from Risinia because of the economical pricing and quality of work but would turn out to be a really bad decision considering the actual completion timeline.",negative
